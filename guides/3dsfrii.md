**A brief explanation of the process.**

When modded, the 3ds is an incredibly easy console to run "backups" on. Out of the box Luma has signature check patches and even the most [commonly used setup guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) sets up FBI.
FBI installs CIA files, which are in simplest terms installation packages for the 3ds.
You can obtain these from dumping them yourself or "commiting fraud" and downloading them from [hshop](https://hshop.erista.me/)

**A few things to note**

The 3DS is limited to a very slow read/write bandwith that makes downloading software quite sluggish. This does NOT have anything to do with a broken console/ SD card this is simply just a hardware limitation

For those who are worried about getting banned, don't. Nintendo does not ban for pirated games. You can play with others online with no problems. This means turning off streetpass is not necessary.

**While the chances of your hardware being damaged are very small, this guide and it's afilliates assume no responsibility if something goes wrong. Blame yourself, your eyes, your hands, your brain, etc.**



DO NOT BLAME US. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

**1. Getting started**

	**What you will need...**

	路A 3ds running CFW

	路CIAS
	
	路FBI

	路An SD card of decently large size


**2. Setup**

	Power off the console and insert your SD into your system. copy your cia files to your preferred directory on the SD. Safely eject the SD once finished and place it back into your console. Power on the console

**3. Open FBI**

	In most cases, FBI will be installed to your home menu. Open FBI and navigate to SD, then to the directory you saved the CIA files. 

	If you have multiple files you want to install all at once, select current directory. Then choose to either install and delete all cia files or just install them.

	Once FBI finishes the installation, close out to the home menu and unwrap everythng you installed.

Wow! wasn't that easy?
