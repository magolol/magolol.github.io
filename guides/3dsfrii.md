**A brief explanation of the process**

When modded, the 3ds is an incredibly easy console to run "backups" on. Stock, Luma3DS has sigpatches and even the most [commonly used setup guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) sets up FBI.
FBI installs `.cia` files, which are in simplest terms installation packages for the 3ds.

`.nds` files are slightly different. `.nds` files are DS game dumps that can be ran through either a flash card or twilight menu. We will cover the twilight menu method.
For DS, please read only steps marked with a b. (1b, 2b, etc)

You can obtain these from dumping them yourself or "commiting fraud" and downloading them from [hshop](https://hshop.erista.me/) or any source of your choosing for DS titles (we recommend 

**A few things to note**

The 3DS is limited to a very slow read/write bandwith that makes downloading software quite sluggish. This does NOT have anything to do with a broken console/ SD card this is simply just a hardware limitation

For those who are worried about getting banned, don't. Nintendo does not ban for unauthorized/pirated games on the 3DS. You can play with others online with no problems. This means turning off streetpass is not necessary.

**While the chances of your hardware being damaged are very small, this guide and it's afilliates assume no responsibility if something goes wrong. Blame yourself, your eyes, your hands, your brain, etc.**
DO NOT BLAME US. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

**Downloads**

For DS backups you will need [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/tag/v23.0.1) 
TWiLight Menu includes NDS Bootstrap, but it is not properly set up for forwarders. If you want to learn more about forwarders, please follow out [this guide.](https://magolol.github.io/guides/3dsforwarders) If you have no interest in direct home menu forwarders, please ignore the guide.
