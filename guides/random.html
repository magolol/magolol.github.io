<h3>The Explanation</h3>


<p style="font-family: Arial">Since Iâ€™m using the CodePen Editor, the default typeface is Times New Roman. That means changing the typeface of a paragraph will require me to use a style attribute that contains the CSS font-family property set to "Comic Sans." The other elements on the page are not targeted by inline CSS and therefore remain Times New Roman.
