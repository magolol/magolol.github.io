**A brief explanation of the process.**

The switch is a very easy system to get CFW running on so long as you have an exploitable system. Read [this](https://ismyswitchpatched.com) and [this](switchgui.de) for more info. 
Stock atmosphere (the only valid CFW at the moment) does not have signature check patches but we can quite easily add them through community made patches.
You can obtain these by [dumping them yourself](https://suchmememanyskill.github.io/guides/switchdumpguide/) or "commiting fraud" and downloading them from a stash or site like [nsw2u](https://nsw2u.xyz/)

**A few things to note**

While hacking the system and installing unauthorized software is very easy, the switch is notorious for having a ton of telemetry which can result in a permanent system ban from all online services.
We have many ways to prevent bans and block telemetry, and it is highly suggested you follow [this guide](https://magolol.github.io/guides/switchbanprotection) before continuing. 

**While the chances of your hardware being damaged are very small, this guide and it's afilliates assume no responsibility if something goes wrong. Blame yourself, your eyes, your hands, your brain, etc.**

DO NOT BLAME US. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

**1. Getting started**

	**What you will need...**

	·A Switch console running cfw

	·NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ files (it doesn't matter which installable you choose, so long as you have the file is what counts.
	
	·Title installer of your choice (This guide encourages the use of Tinwoo for it's simplicity and speed)

	·NS-Usbloader

	·Java (required for NS-usbloader)

	·A USB C cable

	·An SD card of decently large size


**2. Setup**

	Power on the console and launch Tinwoo through a title override

**3. Open FBI**

	In most cases, FBI will be installed to your home menu. Open FBI and navigate to SD, then to the directory you saved the CIA files. 

	If you have multiple files you want to install all at once, select current directory. Then choose to either install and delete all cia files or just install them.

	Once FBI finishes the installation, close out to the home menu and unwrap everythng you installed.

Wow! wasn't that easy?
