Read this and this for more info. But while hacking the system and installing unauthorized software is very easy, the switch is notorious for having a ton of telemetry which can result in a permanent system ban from all online services. We have many ways to prevent bans and block telemetry, and it is highly suggested you take all measures before continuing with anything switch related. emuMMC is a fantastic way to prevent bans when utilized properly, but it is not by itself perfect. But with a little bit of work, we can make it nearly perfect. What will get you banned Modifying Online Games Cheating in online games Using mods in online games Editing save files for online games Making modifications to your sysMMC Installing nsp/*nsz/xci/xcz files Installing homebrew forwarders OR backups (even if you legitimately dumped them!) will get you banned. Clearing logs after they've been sent (this applies to both sysMMC and emuMMC) Running anything to modify your sysMMC Using a custom user picture Doing the above points on emuMMC without using: Exosphere/Incognito dns.mitm Please note we will be doing semi permanent measures. While the chances of your hardware being damaged are very small, this guide and it's afilliates assume no responsibility if something goes wrong. Blame yourself, your eyes, your hands, your brain, etc. ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP. THE BEST BACKUP IS THE ONE YOU MADE BUT NEVER NEED, WHILE THE WORST ONE IS THE ONE YOU NEED BUT NEVER MADE. DO NOT BLAME US. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Downloads (Optional but recommended) Tinfoil (you can choose between which option) 90DNS tester 1. Creating exosphere Start off by creating a file named exosphere.ini on the root of your SD and paste the following: This assumes you are using emuMMC: [exosphere] debugmode=1 debugmode_user=0 disable_user_exception_handlers=0 enable_user_pmu_access=0 blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=0 blank_prodinfo_emummc=1 allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=0 log_port=0 log_baud_rate=115200 log_inverted=0 2. Creating dns.mitm Create a file named emummc.txt in /atmosphere/hosts/ (the hosts folder might not exist, so make sure to create it if it's absent) and paste this in your emummc.txt file: # Block Nintendo Servers 127.0.0.1 *nintendo.* 127.0.0.1 *nintendo-europe.com 127.0.0.1 *nintendoswitch.* 95.216.149.205 *conntest.nintendowifi.net 95.216.149.205 *ctest.cdn.nintendo.net 3. Checking if everything worked Once you're finished creating dns.mitm and exosphere, download the switch 90DNS tester .nro file. Copy it to the switch folder on your SD card. Exit out of the SD and safely eject it. Reinsert it to your system and boot atmosphere. Once in the OS, run the 90dns tester from the homebrew menu. With any luck, all links will be blocked. Restart your device and verify that exosphere is working by going into your Switch's Settings \u279e System \u279e Serial Information. You should see that your serial number will look something like XAW00000000000. 4. (Optional) Installing permanent incognito through Tinfoil !!DO NOT RUN TINFOIL UNTIL YOU HAVE 100% CONFIRMED THE SYSTEM ISN'T REACHING NINTENDO!! If you happen to be running on a Mariko unit, DO NOT FOLLOW THIS STEP. Assuming you already have tinfoil installed, launch it and navigate to the Incognito tab near the bottom. Highlight your serial number in the right space and press Y. Tinfoil will warn you about the consequences if you forget your password. Either set the password as nothing or something simple that you are not going to forget. Should you forget your password, you will be able to pull this back from your NAND backup, worst case. If done correctly, Tinfoil will report writing to CAL0 was successful. Reboot the system. Verify incognito has been enabled correctly by doing the same process as listed in step 3. Incognito is permanent, and relies on no files to stay active. It's best usecase is as a fail safe.

The switch is a very easy system to get CFW running on so long as you have an exploitable system. Read this and this for more info. Stock Atmosph\u00e8re (the only valid CFW at the moment) does not have signature check patches but we can quite easily add them through community made patches. You can obtain these by dumping them yourself or \"commiting fraud\" and downloading them from a stash or site like nsw2u A few things to note While hacking the system and installing unauthorized software is very easy, the switch is notorious for having a ton of telemetry which can result in a permanent system ban from all online services. We have many ways to prevent bans and block telemetry, and it is highly suggested you follow this guide before continuing.

Blame yourself, your eyes, your hands, your brain, etc. ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP. THE BEST BACKUP IS THE ONE YOU MADE BUT NEVER NEED, WHILE THE WORST ONE IS THE ONE YOU NEED BUT NEVER MADE. DO NOT BLAME US. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Downloads DBI Download the DBI.nro , dbi.config , and the dbibackend.exe . If you aren't using windows, you'll need to extract the dbibackend folder from dbibackend.tar.xz Atmosph\u00e8re Patches Grab either zip. 1. Getting started What you will need... -Common Sense -A Switch console running cfw -Atmosph\u00e8re Patches -NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ files (it doesn't matter which installable you choose, so long as you have the file is what counts. -DBI installed on both your switch and pc -A USB C cable -An SD card of decently large size 2. Setup Power off the system (or reboot to hekate) and either eject your SD and insert it into your pc or use hekate's SD UMS tool to access your SD. Open the fusee.zip or hekate.zip (Atmosph\u00e8re patches) and extract the two folders to the root of your SD. Open up the switch folder and make a subfolder titled DBI. Copy DBI.nro and dbi.config to this folder. Safely eject the SD (regardless of which method you use) and boot into Atmosph\u00e8re 3. Launch the DBI Backend Assuming your files are all held in a folder, navigate to that folder. If you're only installing one file, navigate to that file. Once everything is selected, press Start Server. Connect your USB cable to both your switch and PC. 4. Connect your USB cable to both the switch and pc Launch DB Installer from the home menu. If you already launched DBI before connecting the USB, you might need to restart DBI on the switch in order for changes to take effect Select \"Install title from USB\" If all is correct, you will see the files on the switch. You can then use common sense to manually select and deselect what you want installed. Wait for the process to finish, then close out of DBI. Your totally legit backups should now appear on your homescreen. Wow! wasn't that easy?

To check if your switch is patched, please visit this website. Fusee-gelee is a bootrom level hardware exploit nintendo is unable to patch. Every single switch with the vulnerable bootrom is permanently hackable and Nintendo cannot do a single thing to stop you. The exploit was eventually patched leaving the number of exploitable units on a permanent decline. These units can be hacked through hardmods, but we will not cover how to install.
