**Introduction**

Due to a few oversights in the switch's hardware, we're quite easily able to get cfw running on the system, so long as you have a first generation UNPATCHED switch model. 
**To check if your switch is patched, please visit [this website.](https://ismyswitchpatched.com)**

Fusee-gelee is a bootrom level hardware exploit nintendo is unable to patch. Every single switch with the vulnerable bootrom is permanently hackable and Nintendo cannot do a single thing to stop you.
The exploit [was eventually patched](https://twitter.com/SciresM/status/1016724847504736256) leaving the number of exploitable units on a permanent decline. These units can be hacked through hardmods, but we will not cover how to install.
