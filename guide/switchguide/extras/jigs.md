**What is a jig?**

A jig is a tool that slides into your right joycon rail, typically it will ground pins 1 and 10 to activate the Tegra home button. 

There are many different types of jigs. Some you can make, others you can simply [buy off of amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rcm+jig&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

If you want to make your own jig, you can easily do so. However, there is some amount of danger involved, so it's still recommended you buy a proper jig.
You can use tinfoil on the right joycon, a paper clip, or other methods. Since we don't advise the use of these methods, you're on your own for research.
